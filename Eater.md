Please be an active part of the community and vote on the sessions. The process is fairly simple:

1. See currently [proposed sessions](https://github.com/brown-bag/brown-bag.github.com/labels/Session)
1. Read the proposal and if you like it give it a `:+1: (thumbs up)
 - We are a friendly community and therefore we don't down-vote sessions. Feel free to chime in with your suggestions for improving a proposed session. But if you aren't interested in a given topic then simply don't up-vote.
1. Enjoy
