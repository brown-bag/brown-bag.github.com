I would like to invite you to a series of screencasts, dedicated to demystifying Visual Studio Extensibility (VSX).
My goal is to share some of the knowledge I've gathered over the years of developing Visual Studio (and ReSharper) extensions.

In the first screencast, I'd like to cover the very basic concepts of VSX, in what ways Visual Studio can be extended, tools of the trade and more.

This screencast is intended to people new to Visual Studio extensibility. We'll cover the following topics:

 * Getting started with VS SDK
 * Understanding custom Hives
 * Important files, locations and command-line switches.
 * VS Packages (pkgdef) and VSIX (vsixmanifests)
 * Basic troubleshooting
